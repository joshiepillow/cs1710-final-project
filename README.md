# Mentor-Mentee Matching Model (Forge)

This model explores **stable matchings between Mentors and Mentees** using Forge, with a focus on evaluating fairness across multiple dimensions. It models preference lists, match structures, and fairness metrics, and provides experiments to reveal tradeoffs between them.

---

## Signatures

### `sig Person`

Represents a participant in the system. Each `Person` is either a `Mentor` or `Mentee`.

### `sig List`

A linked-list node used to represent preference rankings.

- `person`: the person this node refers to.
- `next`: optional reference to the next node.

### `abstract sig Group`

An abstract group (either `Mentor` or `Mentee`).

- `priorities`: maps each person in the group to their preference list head.

### `sig Match`

Represents a symmetric, bijective matching between people.

- `pair`: set of paired `Person -> Person`.

### `one sig Interval`

A temporal container for available `Person -> Person` pairs across time.

### `one sig Mentor`, `one sig Mentee`

Concrete subtypes of `Group`.

---

## Predicates

### `pred init`

Initializes a valid instance:

- Ensures persons belong to exactly one group.
- Assigns complete and disjoint preference lists.
- Ensures well-formed, non-redundant lists.

### `pred valid_match[m: Match]`

A valid match must:

- Be symmetric.
- Match every person to someone in the opposite group.
- Avoid self-matching.

### `pred stable_match[m: Match]`

A stable match has no blocking pair:

- No two unmatched individuals mutually prefer each other over their current match.

---

## Fairness Metrics

### `pred egalitarian[m1, m2]`

`m1` is better if it has **lower total cost** than `m2`.

- Reflects utilitarian ethics: maximizes total satisfaction across all participants.
- Ignores distributional fairness â€” may privilege majority preferences, as one group may be consistently worst off.

### `pred groupEqual[m1, m2]`

`m1` is better if the **group cost difference** between mentors and mentees is smaller than in `m2`.

- Prioritize equity between groups, especially when there is a power asymmetry between groups
- May equalize low ranks - neither group is well served.

### `pred balanced[m1, m2]`

`m1` is better if its **worst group cost** is no greater than `m2`'s.

- Focus on the worst off group not the difference, avoid scenarios where one group bears most of the burden
- Protecting one group at all costs may lower overall match satisfaction

### `pred regretEqual[m1, m2]`

`m1` is better if the **worst-case regret** in each group is more balanced than in `m2`.

- Emphasize fairness in worst-case experiences between groups, judged by relative group experience at the margins
- May lead to high overall regret just to equalize extremes.

### `pred minRegret[m1, m2]`

`m1` is better if the **maximum individual regret** is lower than in `m2`.

- Focus on the single person with the highest regret â€” minimizing how badly the worst-off person fares.
- Rawlsian fairness â€” the just society is the one that does best for the least advantaged.
- May favor outliers (e.g., one happy person and everyone else miserable)

## Matching Algorithm (Interval-Based Proposal Refinement)

This model implements a temporal version of the **deferred acceptance algorithm** using a relation called `Interval.intervals`, which evolves over time.

### How It Works

- Initially, all cross-group pairings are **considered possible** (`init` sets `Interval.intervals` to the full bipartite set).
- At each step (`update`), each person proposes to their top available choice, and each person keeps their **best** proposal (based on preferences).
- The algorithm **removes all worse options** from the intervals.
- This process continues until the set of considered options is **constant** (`constant`).
- When no further pruning is possible, the algorithm has **converged** to a final set of stable pairings.

### `one sig Interval`

A temporal relation used by the interval-based algorithm to model evolving proposals over time.

- `var intervals: set Person -> Person`: represents who is still being considered as a valid match by each person.

### Predicates

- `update`: One round of proposing and rejecting.
- `constant`: No more updates needed (fixpoint).
- `eventuallyConstant`: Fixpoint will eventually be reached.
- `groupOptimal[m, group]`: Asserts that a match `m` selects each personâ€™s best partner at fixpoint.
- `associatedList[p, q]`: Helper to retrieve where `q` appears in `p`'s list.

### Formal Guarantees

- Termination is enforced with the `eventuallyConstant` property.
- The resulting set of intervals always encodes at least one stable matching.
- By fixing a group (e.g., `Mentor`) and always choosing each member's best available partner, we can recover the Mentor-optimal stable matching via `groupOptimal`.

## Design Rationale and Tradeoffs

### What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?

<!-- We chose a **linked list representation (`List`)** for preference rankings because it aligns naturally with Forge's structural constraints and enables easy reasoning over list traversal. While this is more verbose than an array-style or `seq`-based approach, it provided full control over the shape and consistency of preference lists, which was essential for enforcing uniqueness and completeness. -->

<!-- We originally considered modeling preferences as `Person -> Int` mappings, but that made it hard to enforce constraints like "no repeats" and list contiguity. We also experimented with modeling preferences via ordered sets, but Forge lacks native order types, making such attempts fragile.

To keep matchings symmetric, we modeled them as `pair: set Person -> Person` and added constraints in `valid_match` to enforce bidirectionality. This avoids having to explicitly maintain inverse relations, but it means the model has to enforce mutuality manually. -->

## Scope and Limitations

### What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?

We assume:

- Each person ranks **all members of the opposite group** (complete, strict preferences).
- Matchings are **one-to-one** and **perfect** (no unmatched individuals).
- Each group (`Mentor`, `Mentee`) has the **same number of members**.

This means the model does not support:

- Incomplete or partial rankings.
- Ties in preferences.
- Uneven group sizes or optional matchings.

In practice, this limits the modelâ€™s applicability to **structured, idealized matching scenarios** (e.g., internships or mentorship pairings with symmetric expectations). However, the model is still useful for **comparing fairness metrics** in settings where each person must be matched.

Most experiments run with `6 Person` and `10 List` â€” enough to surface multiple stable matchings while still being small enough for Forgeâ€™s solver to handle exhaustively.

## ðŸ§© How to Understand the Model

### How should we understand an instance of your model and what your visualization shows?

Each instance consists of:

- A set of `Person`s split into `Mentors` and `Mentees`.
- Each person has a linked list of preferences over the opposite group.
- A `Match` assigning every person to a unique partner from the other group.

The **custom visualization**:

- Shows each person's preferences top-to-bottom in colored boxes.
- Highlights their actual match in a darker background.
- Draws matched pairs as colored circles below, showing group membership and partner connection.
- Displays **fairness metrics** in a nea
